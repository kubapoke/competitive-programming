# Competitive programming
## Introduction
This repository currently serves primarily an archival 
function of storing my programs related to competitive
programming. When I finally have the time to return to 
competitive programming I will most likely update this 
repository with new contents.

### Archive
Contains mostly old competitive programming codes, which I
have managed to gather. The archive is currently incomplete
containing only codes from [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
and [Szkopu≈Ç](https://szkopul.edu.pl/), the latter being primarily
solutions to the [Polish Olympiad in Informatics](https://www.oi.edu.pl/)
tasks.

I plan to update it with codes from different contests,
when I finally manage to find categorize them.

### Resources
Contains competitive programming resources (algorithms and data structures)
primarily from the extracurricular lessons that I've conducted
at the [6th General Secondary School in Bydgoszcz](https://vilo.bydgoszcz.pl/).

#### Notes
The vast majority of the codes currently in this repository come from before
I've started studying Computer Science and Information Systems
at my university, therefore they (when it comes
to their aesthetics and proficiency) don't reflect my current 
programming skill level. Nonetheless, I believe that the
archive is a good showcase of my competitive programming
experience.
